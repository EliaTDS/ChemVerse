# Periodic Table Metaverse Project

Welcome to the **Periodic Table Metaverse** project, where every element becomes a unique coin on the **Solana blockchain**. This innovative platform aims to transform the periodic table into a functional part of the metaverse, with each element turning into a token that can be minted, spent, and staked.

## Project Phases

### Phase 0: Initial Design & Hydrogen Coin Launch
- We're building the foundation of the website and defining the layout of the periodic table.
- **Hydrogen** coin is launched as the first coin, representing the starting point of this revolutionary journey in the metaverse.

### Phase 1: Coin Minting
- Every element in the periodic table will be minted as a unique token on the Solana blockchain, giving them a digital life.

### Phase 2: Building Community & Interactivity
- In this phase, we focus on building an active community and introducing interactive features, turning the metaverse into a living, breathing entity.

### Phase 3: Spending Elements to Create Molecules & Entropy Coin
- Users can spend their elements to create **Molecules**, which are new coins that can only be obtained by combining existing elements.
- The creation of Molecules will require **Entropy**, a new coin that can be earned by staking elements.

### Phase 4: Engaging Major Metaverse Players
- We will integrate with major metaverse platforms like **Decentraland**, **The Sandbox**, and **Somnium Space**, expanding the reach and functionality of our project.

## Technologies Used

- **Solana Blockchain**: For minting and staking coins.
